### Description: 
This program uses synchronous keys for encrypting or decrypting a plain text. If key K1 is used for encrypting a plain text, then only K1 can decrypt the cypher text.

######                               **PlainText   ----K1---->  CypherText  (ENCRYPTION)**
######                            **CypherText ----K1---->    PlainText    (DECRYPTION)**

The key is generated by shuffling the ASCII characters from 32 to 126 in the ASCII Table.
